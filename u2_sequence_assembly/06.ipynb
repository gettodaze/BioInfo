    "### PROBLEM 1: Finding the maximum overlap length of two strings (reads) (1 POINT)\n",
    "\n",
    "A key component of most algorithms for addressing the shortest superstring problem is determining the length of the longest exact overlap between two strings.  In particular, for two strings, $left$ and $right$, we need to compute $overlap\\_length(left, right)$, which is defined as the length of the longest **suffix** of $left$ that is a **prefix** of $right$.  Define a function that computes this value.  You may find the [endswith](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.endswith) or [startswith](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith) methods of Python string objects helpful.  You do not need to implement the most efficient algorithm possible (a simple polynomial-time algorithm will suffice)."

    "One way to think about constructing a superstring for a set of strings (reads) is to note that any given superstring imposes an ordering on the input strings, namely, the order in which those strings appear as substrings within the superstring.  With the assumption that no input string is a substring of any other input string, for any fixed ordering of of the input strings, there is a unique shortest superstring that imposes that ordering.  That superstring may be constructed by simply merging strings from left to right in the ordering, using the maximum possible overlap between adjacent strings.  Write a function below that computes the shortest superstring for a given ordered list of strings (reads).  You will likely need your `overlap_length` function from above."

In an adjacency list data structure, for each vertex, a list of vertices to which that vertex is connected by an edge is maintained.  For directed graphs, two lists per vertex can be used, one for all vertices that are adjacent via an *outgoing* edge and one for all vertices that are adjacent via an *incoming* edge.\n",
